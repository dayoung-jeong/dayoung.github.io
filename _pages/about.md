---

I am an HCI researcher and a Ph.D. candidate in Artificial Intelligence at Hanyang University, working with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=htyp0xsAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Prof. Kyungsik Han</a> in <a href="https://hcc.hanyang.ac.kr/" target="_blank">Human-Centered Computing Lab</a>.

My research interests lie in Human-AI Interaction and Ubiquitous Computing, with a focus on computational user modeling through multimodal data. I investigate how human states and contextual information can be represented to design adaptive, human-centered interactive systems.

Prior to my graduate studies, I received a B.S. in <a href="https://ece.ajou.ac.kr/ece/index.do" target="_blank">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> from <a href="https://www.ajou.ac.kr/en/index.do" target="_blank">Ajou University</a>.
